        At least 78 people have died of cold in Afghanistan during the countrys
        worst winter in more than a decade, authorities said on Thursday. Deaths
        from the cold have been recorded in eight of the countrys 34 provinces,
        officials said. The coldest winter in 15 years, which has seen
        temperatures dip as low as -34 degrees Celsius, has hit Afghanistan in
        the middle of a severe economic crisis. Many aid groups have partially
        suspended operations in recent weeks due to a Taliban ruling that most
        female NGO workers could not work, leaving agencies unable to operate
        many programmes in the conservative country. “The weather will get
        colder in the next few days, therefore it is necessary to consider
        humanitarian aid for affected people,” said Abdullah Ahmadi, the head of
        the operations centre for emergency conditions at the Ministry of
        Disaster Management. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
        Affairs (UNOCHA) said last week that the restrictions on female workers
        were hampering efforts to deliver aid. “Humanitarian partners are
        providing winterization support to families, including heating, cash for
        fuel and warm clothes, but distributions have been severely impacted by
        the ban on female NGO aid workers,” it said. Even in the early part of
        winter, health workers had reported a sharp increase in the number of
        young children suffering from serious cases of pneumonia and other
        respiratory diseases, in part due to worsening poverty that left people
        unable to properly heat their homes. Around 77,000 livestock have also
        died in the past nine days, threatening to deepen the countrys food
        insecurity. “Lost livelihoods and assets further endanger Afghan
        families at a time when 21.2 million people urgently need continued food
        and agricultural support,” said UNOCHA on Twitter.
